### TODO
Didn't have time to do but however I aware of this issue

- [ ] Use Sass  
- [ ] Remove data-testid in production
- [ ] Bonus: Use the geolocation browser API in order to find the userâ€™s location, pre-populate the form and display the weather forecast when the page has loaded: 
      (didn't have time but | know how to do Geolocation.getCurrentPosition(), which then uses https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?lattlong=36.96,-122.02 to get the city ) 

- [x] TypeScript
- [x] Use Debounce
- [x] JSX if possible
- [x] Use .env.example
- [x] Display the weather forecast for the next four days of the given location
- [x] General description of the weather
- [x] Minimum and maximum temperature
- [x] Wind speed
- [x] Create a simple form that takes a location as an input parameter.
- [x] Javascript (ES6)
- [x] Add tests (React testing framework)
- [x] Prettier, ESLint 
- [x] Ensure that the application outputs production-ready artifacts
